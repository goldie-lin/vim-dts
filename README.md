vim-dts
=======

Linux kernel DTS/DTSI syntax highlighting for Vim

Mirror of dts.vim from Ubuntu 14.04
(`/usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/dts.vim` in `vim-runtime` package.)


Motivation
----------

*   Useful for backporting to Ubuntu 12.04 or older environment.
*   Separate into one standalone syntax file is good for installing with
    [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim),
    [Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim),
    or [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
